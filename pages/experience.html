        <p>Will Nock attended Massachusetts Maritime Acadmey in Buzzards Bay, Massachusetts graduating with a B.S. in Marine Safety and Environmental Protection in 2006.</p>
        <p>His first job was with the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) where he gained experience in new build projects at Hyundia Mipo Dockyard (HMD) in Ulsan, South Korea, after construction in China, and offshore (VLCC to FPSO) conversions in Dubai. Finally, he transferred to Ft. Lauderdale, FL USA where he became involved in the yachting industry.</p>
        <p>After staying at home for a year when his son was born, he joined International Registries, Inc. (IRI), the Maritime Admistrator for the Republic of the Marshall Islands Registry, where he was the Safety &amp; Technical Manager.  Upon leaving IRI, he was in charge of managing a project for Navalimpianti where he ran the largest project to date for the company, installing new davit arms in a Carnival Cruise ship in Trieste, Italy.</p>
        <p>Upon completing the project in Italy, he was asked to run United Maritime Survey (UMS), which combined his previous experience with ABS and IRI to perform surveys on behalf of the Marshall Islands.</p>
        <p>In 2017, he used his combined skillset to start Dayboard Maritime, a yacht management company based in South Florida.</p>
